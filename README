This directory contains the 1.0 release of dot2ubi.

dot2ubi plots graphs (as in "edges and vertices", not "pie charts and
bar charts") with a 3-D layout.  It reads a graph description in
Graphviz ("dot") format and communicates the graph to a Ubigraph
server application for rendering.

    Graphviz home page: http://www.graphviz.org/
    Ubigraph home page: http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/

Note that the Ubigraph server is free but closed-source software.

Installation instructions appear in the INSTALL file.

Documentation is provided in the form of a Unix man page.

dot2ubi is provided under a BSD license.  See the LICENSE file for the
complete legal text.
