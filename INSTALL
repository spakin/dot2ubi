Installation instructions for dot2ubi
=====================================

Build dot2ubi by running "make".  There is no configure script.

Prerequisites include the GraphViz development files (e.g.,
libcgraph), the XMLRPC development files (e.g., libxmlrpc), and the
Ubigraph client (libubigraphclient).  If installed in standard
locations, the Makefile ought to find these automatically.

Unfortunately, the Ubigraph distribution does not put the client
library in standard locations but rather under examples/C/.  Either
move libubigraphclient.a to a standard lib directory or edit the
UBIGRAPH_LDLIBS line in the Makefile to point to libubigraphclient.a.

Compile with "make".

Install with "make install".  By default, this installs dot2ubi into
/usr/bin.  To install elsewhere, pass the "prefix" variable to make
(or edit the Makefile); for example, "make prefix=/usr/local" installs
dot2ubi into /usr/local/bin.
